FPGA Vending Machine Project

Utilized Intelâ€™s Quartus Prime software and Verilog HDL to engineer and simulate a digital vending machine system on an Altera FPGA board.
Developed a comprehensive circuit that integrated sequential and combinational logic to enable product selection, payment processing, and change dispensation functionalities.
Implemented state machine logic to manage the vending machine's operational states, including waiting for input, processing selections, verifying payment, and dispensing products.
Designed a user-friendly interface on the FPGA board with buttons for product selection and LEDs to indicate status, such as successful transaction or insufficient funds.
Conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure reliability and user satisfaction in the vending machine operation.
